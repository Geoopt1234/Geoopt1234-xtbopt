UNPAIRED_ELECTRON = 0 for almost all cases.
You can use `--ceasefiles` to	reduce secondary file outputs (Less cluttering. However, the Zenovo link should always contain every technical files, including ones that would be deleted if using the --ceasefiles).
`--verbose` is used to provide detailed screen output for debugging/monitoring.
`--strict` is used to turn all warnings into hard errors. In practice, this means if any non-fatal runtime warning is generated during the calculation, the program will stop immediately instead of completing with a warning message. This will save time from calculating the wrong/incomplete geometry.
