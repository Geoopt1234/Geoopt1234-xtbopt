# Geoopt1234-xtbopt
This is my personal library that contains the .sdf and all of the technical files of interested molecule.
No need for asking me to have permission to use the file for future development of computational chemistry.
To get started, start with the class of the molecules you're interested (i.e. alkaloids, WHO drugs etc...)
Each molecule folder contains .sdf, a command that specify the exact caclulation, other lightweight technical files if needed, and heavy technical files needed for verfication such as `hessian`, `xtbopt.log`, `g98.out`, and `gfnff_topo` (if any)
