# Geoopt1234-xtbopt
This is a library that contains the optimized sdf files of interested chemical substances (WHO EML 2025, alkaloids, etc...) and all of the technical files of interested molecule.
No need for asking me to have permission to use the file for future development of computational chemistry or any chemically related fields/companies/studies. Please read `LICENSE` if you're unsure what to do.
To get started, start with the class of the molecules you're interested (i.e. alkaloids, WHO drugs etc...).
Each molecule folder contains xtbopt.sdf, `command.txt` that specify the exact command for calculation, and `Zenovo.txt` that will contain ta link to all other technical files needed for verfication such as `hessian`, `xtbopt.log`, `g98.out`, `gfnff_topo` (if any), etc...
